PRA and Testing

<body>UiPath is a robotic process automation tool for large-scale end-to-end automation.
For an accelerated business change, it provides solutions for businesses to automate routine office activities. It uses a variety of methods to transform tedious tasks into automated processes.
I have created my project in such a way that it streamlines processes, uncovers efficiencies and provides insights, making it effective for important Analytics and creating a better customer service experience. I also find that it boosts productivity across the board.

It is important to notice that I have implemented the functionality to create,update new records as well as ask the user for input to change any record or entry of thier choice.
users are also able to create new excel sheets along with headers and column names.
This makes it much more effective manipulating data.

I have also hosted my process on UiPath Orchestrator and it took me 10 hours to complete this project</body>
