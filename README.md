PRA and Testing

<h2> Here I adress which repositories will be created and used for each project</h2>
<body> The way I will approach creating repositories and prjoects is by creating a single 
  repository and adding each project to that repository/kanban as the semester continues.
  This is bound to change as I am already thinking of changing the way I want to manage my projects within repos and my repos within my projects</body>

<h4>Here I explain the branching strategy to be used within each project </h4>
<body>So I will Use feature branches for all new features and bug fixes, then merge these feature branches into the main branch using pull requests.
This will help me maintian a high quality, up to date main branch
This is bound to change, as I am creating this readme file I am alraedy thinking of changing my strategy</body>
<h5>Here I explain the use of a .gitignore file within each project </h5>
<body> The following files the files that should be ignored 
-Log files
-Files with API keys and secrets,credentials and sensitive information
-Usless system files
-Generated files like dist filders
-Dependencies which can be downlaoded from a package manager

 I will manage this by Placing the .gitignore file in the rootfolder of the repository</body>

<h6>Here I explain the storage of credentials and sensitive information </h6>
<body>The best way that I can think of protecting and storing sensitive information and credentials is adding a SECURITY.md file that highlights security related information for the projects this semester </body>
